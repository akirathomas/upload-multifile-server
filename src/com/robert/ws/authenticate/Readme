How token-based authentication works

In token-based authentication, the client exchanges hard credentials (such as username and password) for a piece of data called token. 
Instead of sending the hard credentials in every request, the client will send the token to the server to perform authentication and authorization.

In a few words, an authentication scheme based on tokens follow these steps:

1. The client sends their credentials (username and password) to the server.
2. The server authenticates the credentials and generates a token.
3. The server stores the previously generated token in some storage along with the user identifier and an expiration date.
4. The server sends the generated token to the client.
5. In every request, the client sends the token to the server.
6. The server, in each request, extracts the token from the incoming request. 
	With the token, the server looks up the user details to perform authentication and authorization.
	6.1 If the token is valid, the server accepts the request.
	6.2 If the token is invalid, the server refuses the request.
7. The server can provide an endpoint to refresh expired tokens.
